# About the Team

The Polymtrade team is a small, focused group of three builders based in Central Europe. We're not a VC-backed company or a flashy Web3 collective — just a tight-knit crew working to make prediction markets more accessible and powerful.

## Who We Are

- A marketer/designer responsible for product vision and user experience
- A backend developer with deep experience in DeFi integrations
- A frontend developer focused on speed, responsiveness, and mobile-first design

## Not Public (For Now)

We’re not active on X and not public figures. Our focus is on **shipping fast, stable products**, not cultivating personal brands. Collectively, we have **over 10 years of experience** building in the crypto space.

That said, if a major partnership or opportunity requires identity verification or transparency, **we’re ready to doxx** when the time is right.

> We’re here to build long-term. Not hype — just results.
