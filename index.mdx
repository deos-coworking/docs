Polymtrade is the first dedicated mobile trading terminal designed exclusively for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) — the world’s leading prediction market platform. Built for speed, accessibility, and professional-grade tools, Polymtrade redefines how traders interact with markets — especially on mobile.

## Why Polymtrade?

While Polymarket has revolutionized decentralized prediction markets, it still lacks a mobile application. Its web interface is limited, outdated, and not designed for fast, responsive trading on the go.

- **4x faster performance** on mobile compared to the Polymarket site
- **Mobile-native UI** with real-time price tracking and volume metrics
- **AI-powered insights** for smarter trading decisions
